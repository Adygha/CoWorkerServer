# CoWorkerServer
A project for the "2DV603 - Software Engineering - Design" course at Linnaeus University.

Many parts of the code needs comments (and may not be commented for a while) but I hope all seems straight forward and clear.

# The Application
The application contributes to increased cooperation between all co-workers in a company to be up to date with the company's goals and their progress, giving the co-workers also a chance to to comment on the company's goals and give their opinions. Additionally, the application provides a chat section.
